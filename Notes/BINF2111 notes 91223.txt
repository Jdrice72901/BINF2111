grep -oE "chi$(printf'\t')bill" doppenganger_names.txt

prints: chi	bill
says to look for chi, then at the end of chi use print f to add a tab, and that should be near bill. 

Bourne Shell (sh)

shell line interpreter
default shell for version 7 Unix

Variants 
C Shell: Bill Joy(author)nobody uses

Korn Shell(David Korn)

Z shell
Schilly Bourne shell
rd: (Bell labs)

BASH
unix shell written by brian fox, released in 1989
default for apple until 2019 and release of macos catalina changed it to zsh

Acronym for Bourne Again Shell


creating BASH SCRIPT

printf '#!/bin/bash' > script.sh

printf 'whoami\n' >>script.sh

bash script.sh //runs the bash script

bash 
MYVAR1="2"
echo $MYVAR1 output 2
full_name="Your name"
echo full_name output Your name


variables are place holders that echo reads out for us 

Global variables, available in all shells 

Local variables, available in their shell only 

illegal variable names!!!
1myvar
my-var
my.var
my:var
NEVER DO THESE

BONUS
bash script that states 150kg at 178cm is overweight

count how many times chi is left to bill
grep -cP "chi\tbill" doppelganger_names.txt





THursday notes 

printf '#!/bin/bash\n# THis is my firat comment\n'>script.sh

output :

#!/bin/bash
# This is my first comment

printf '#!/bin/bash\n \n# THisis my script/n' > script.sh
always \n the end of a printf command to end the line 



String Variables

Integers variables

Constant variables- EX: pi 

Array variable- list 


Secuence foles are commonly Fasta format representing nucleotide sewuences or amino acid protien as single letter codes.

Nucleotides - A, T, C, G, U

Pairs

A-T double bond

G-C tripple bond 

U-A double bond

varius fasta formats- .fa, .fasta, .ffn, .fna

Best: .fna(fasta nucleotide file -contigs/reads

.ffa-fasta feature nucleotide(nucleotide or protien ORFs)

.fq - fastq fasta data and quality encoded(raw/trip reads)

quality scores run from 0-21, 
lowest quality =! 
highest quality = ~

A quality Q 
using sanger variant to assess reliability of a base call
Q sanger = -10 -log10p
UYsing Illumina (solex) genome analyzer earlier used a different mappigng, ancoding the odds p/(1-p) instead of probability of p 
Q solexa (prior to 1.3v)= -10log10p / 1-p

40 is the highest score for string varaiables - fastq

Phred quality score
10-Very bad 1 in 10 probability of incorrect base call 90% accuracy 
40- best currently available 1 in 10,000 99.99% accuracy
60- best theoretically possible 1 in 1,000,000 99.9999%

Some essential amino acids that the body dosent produce and get through food. 

Amino acid format is .faa 
always used 


array variables in BASH

no max size.
